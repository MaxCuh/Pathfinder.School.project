About Pathfinder

Pathfinder is a coding AI partner that is used as a coding tool for all levels, from beginner to advanced.
Pathfinder is a fully functional website that uses "deepseek" AI to allow users to ask anything wether code related or anything else.
On top of that Pathfinder is an amazing recourse website that gives you URL links to other websites to allow you to learn many different concepts and coding languages.
